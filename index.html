    <h3>Minimum spanning tree - Kruskal's algorithm
    </h3>
    <p>Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is
        connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree. (A minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is a subset of the
        edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree is
        minimized. For a disconnected graph, a minimum spanning forest is composed of a minimum spanning tree for each
        connected component.) It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as in each step it adds the next lowest-weight
        edge that will not form a cycle to the minimum spanning forest.</p>
